 - arrays in Java are objects;
 - store a collection of primitive data types and a collection of objects;
 - steps of creating an array:
 	1) declaring the array;
 	2) allocating the arra;
 	3) initializing the array elements.
 - created with the new operator;
 - unordered arrays offer fast insertion but slow searching and deletion;
 - a binary search can be applied to an ordered array;
 - linear searches require time proportional to the number of items in an array (O(n));
 - binary searches require time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items O(log(n));
 - an algorithm that runs in O(1) time is the Best, O(log N) is Good, O(N) is Fair, and O(N2) is pretty Bad.
